"""
    Usage:
        This is a script that splits the training, validation and testing set, 
        and the proportion is 7:1:2. Run this script before running 4_train.sh 
        and 4_test.sh using the following command:
            bash 4_train.sh
            bash 4_test.sh

        Also you can run the training and testing scripts here by commenting 
        prepare_input_for_transformer and uncommenting the sub-processes. You might 
        need to set up right permissions first by
            chmod +x 4_{train, test}.sh
        Remember to SET UP the hyperparameters first! These are mainly in 4_{train, test}.sh 
        and option.py. 

    Input: 
        Graph embeddings
    Output: 
        Classification result
