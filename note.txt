Try to make a run.py as an entry for each stage. 

* 1: Tile WSI

Set -M to 1

* 2: Train patch feature extractor

Set batch_size to 32 in config.yaml
    We have 398 patches of the minisample. 
Set weight_decay to 10e-5
Throw apex away in simclr.py since it is not used
Discard the 20x magnification in run.py
    We haven't made use of magnification in stage 1, though I have no idea whether they are related. 

* 3: Construct graphs

Set :arg batch_size to 16 in build_graphs.py, half of the value we used before
Set :arg magnification to 5x
    Honestly I'm worried about the overall influence of magnification from different stages.
