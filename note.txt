Try to make a run.py as an entry for each stage. 

* 1: Tile WSI

Set -M to 1

* 2: Train patch feature extractor

Set batch_size to 32 in config.yaml
    We have 398 patches of the minisample. 
Set weight_decay to 10e-5
Throw apex away in simclr.py since it is not used
Discard the 20x magnification in run.py
    We haven't made use of magnification in stage 1, though I have no idea whether they are related.
