Try to make a run.py as an entry for each stage. 

* 1: Tile WSIs

Set -M to 1

* 2: Train a patch feature extractor

Set batch_size to 32 in config.yaml
    We have 398 patches of the minisample. 
Set weight_decay to 10e-5
Throw apex away in simclr.py since it is not used
Discard the 20x magnification in run.py
    We haven't made use of magnification in stage 1, though I have no idea whether they are related. 

* 3: Construct graphs

Set :arg batch_size to 16 in build_graphs.py, half of the value we used before
Set :arg magnification to 1x
    Honestly I'm worried about the overall influence of magnification from different stages. 
    To deal with the file reading issues several lines of code have been added. Please review the new if branch at line 103 to ensure you understand the changes in the path. 
Set :arg num_classes to 512 to match the size from the checkpoint
    Honestly I don't know why they set it to 512 before.
Add CPU ver in build_graphs.py by changing .cuda() and .load()

* 4: Train and test the graph transformer

Add ISUP grade mapping in utils/dataset.py
Change both graphs and labels reading logic in utils/dataset.py
