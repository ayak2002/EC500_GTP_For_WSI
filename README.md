# EC500: GTP for WSI  

In this EC500 team project, we will fine-tune a Graph Transformer for Digital Pathology on a Whole-Slide Images (WSI) dataset for Prostate Cancer. 

### Workflow

The basic idea is to implement the whole model step by step and create an entrance for each stage. Usages are included in the entrance files. Then we will analyze and adjust the structure of the model to achieve the best performance. 

To build the model, run `{Step Number}_run.py` one by one.
